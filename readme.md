I will build this MusicApp with authentication step by step, having all the steps here, as well as committing early and often, so that if I have to go back, I can easily see what fragments of the code were relevant. Simultaneous to this, I will also reference the source material.

1. Start a new rails project but have the PSQL DB so
        rails new MusicApp -d postgresql

2. Start new Git Project to Keep track.

GIT COMMIT 1: Initial Project Start
